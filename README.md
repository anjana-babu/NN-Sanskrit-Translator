# NN-Sanskrit-Translator
A neural network based translator for Sanskrit. The reason for this project is, partly, to learn Sanskrit ;)

Outline:
1. Create a neural network based translator 
	Source language: Sanskrit
	Target language: Malayalam/other languages

Phase I: Sanskrit to another language (Malayalam)
Re-invent the wheel using Recurrent Neural Networks.
Phase II: Sanskrit to more languages
Phase III: Translation between any languages covered in Phases I and II. 
This should involve picking up a proper pathway of translations to achieve the best translation. Sanskrit needn't necessarily be the "fulcrum". May be even direct translation without an intermediate translation? Needs to think and outline it well!
